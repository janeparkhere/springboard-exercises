What data is provided?
How is it set up?
Missing data? What needs to be 'tidied?'

Questions I could already answer through this; what can I do with/learn from this data right now?
How I'd figure that out


ggplot2: proportions of black and white with certain score brackets?
-trend across age, location, income, crime type, sentence (length/type)

compare to what actually happened
- how many future charges/convictions
- how soon they happened after the first charge/conviction
